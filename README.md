# Confidential Ledger  
**Confidential Real-Time Fraud Detection with CyborgDB, TEEs, and Polygon**

---

## Overview

This repository contains a **production-grade infrastructure and code scaffold** for a real-time fraud detection system built using:

- **Confidential Computing (AWS Nitro Enclaves)**
- **CyborgDB** for confidential vector similarity search
- **Rust & Python** for enclave-based ML inference
- **Off-chain attestation verifier**
- **Polygon (EVM) smart contracts** for trust enforcement
- **Kubernetes (EKS)** for orchestration
- **Terraform (AWS)** for infrastructure provisioning

This is **not a demo app** and **not a turnkey deployment**.  
It is a **correct, reviewable, extensible foundation** for building a production system.
